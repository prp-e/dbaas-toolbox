# Toolbox for DBaaS 

This is just the base ground of my new company or startup I should say. In this project, I'm going to invent a new DBaaS. Everything is set, as far as I know. 

## TODO 

- [x] Randomizing the ports 
- [x] Check if port is already taken from the network adapter. 
- [x] Making a simple API for the basic tests 
- [x] Handling `MYSQL_USER` priveleges, so no `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` will be needed of course. 
- [ ] Integrating the whole thing with Rails application.
